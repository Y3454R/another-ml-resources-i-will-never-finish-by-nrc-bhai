# Machine Learning Resources

## 1. Introduction to Statistical Learning

**Description:** Introduction to Stat learning: regression, discriminant analysis; cross-validation and the bootstrap, model selection and regularization methods (ridge and lasso); nonlinear models, splines and generalized additive models, and other learning models. Talks about mathematical intuition (medium difficulty) and application with R.

- **Book:** https://www.statlearning.com/ (The only book that I read on machine learning)

## 2. Mathematics of Machine Learning

**Description:** This is more on the heavier part of mathematics used in ML.

## 3. Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Course

**Description:** These are the lectures from his Coursera specialization.

- **Course 1,2,3, 5:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1viKCmRVjYJHBePWMUBHRIBqdNB7L_Jt
- **Course 4 (CNN):** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkDaE6sCZn6Gl29AoE31iwdVwSG-KnDzF
- **Learn for free:** https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning

To earn a certificate, apply for financial aid. I spent 0$ on Coursera and almost got all certifications for free by applying to the aid program.

## 4. NLP with Deep Learning

**Description:** Introduction to cutting-edge neural networks for NLP, PyTorch implementation, and mathematics (design, implement, and understand their own neural network models, using the Pytorch framework)

- **Playlist:** https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOaMFbaqxPDoLWjDaRAdP9D
- **Codes and materials:** https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/

## 5. Language Modeling from Scratch

**Description:** Language model creation, including data collection and cleaning for pre-training, transformer model construction, model training, and evaluation before deployment (This course teaches fundamentals; don't expect to apply LLM applications directly from the course outcomes, as it doesn't teach hot techniques.)

## 6. Reinforcement Learning

### Theory-heavy Reinforcement Learning by Dimitri Bertsekas

## Note

There might be better materials. I am not an AI, ML expert, but I followed these contents to keep my knowledge current. I am still learning the language models. My research is more in the constrained mathematical optimization field. If you are more interested in this field, connect with me to learn more.
